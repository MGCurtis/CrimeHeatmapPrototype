# CrimeHeatmapPrototype
This repository is to house the prototype for my Final Year Project in Computer Science in DIT. The goal of the project is to design an application that will generate a heat map of the country's crime rates over a map of the country. This will be done using a database, a django back end that will communcate with that database, and a front end application that will communicate with the django back end. For the purposes of this prototype only the rudimentary functionality has been implemented, this being that there is a front end app displaying a map and calling some data from a database to display on the map.
